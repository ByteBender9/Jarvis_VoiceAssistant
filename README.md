## 📌 Introduction

Jarvis is a Python-based desktop voice assistant that enables users to interact with their computer using voice commands. It leverages speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to automate everyday tasks such as searching the web, opening websites, playing music, taking notes, capturing screenshots, and retrieving information from Wikipedia.

The assistant greets the user based on the current time, listens to voice commands through the microphone, processes them, and performs the requested actions, providing a hands-free and user-friendly computing experience.
